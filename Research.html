        <p>Plant reproduction is of fundamental importance to human society,
          not least because our staple foods are frequently its direct products – the seeds.
          Despite its importance, how the reproductive function and fate are
          installed and maintained precisely in the reproductive lineages is still unresolved.
          In the Feng Lab, we work at the interface of developmental biology and epigenetics to answer this question.
          We primarily work on male reproduction, and we are able to isolate pure population from multiple stages of the developmental process.
          Our work has uncovered novel and surprising mechanisms in the developing germline, and has implications for crop improvement in a changing world.</p>

        <h2>DNA Methylation: Maintenance vs Reprogramming</h2>
        <p>In the germlines of animals, epigenetic reprogramming is total – DNA methylation is broadly removed, and in the male germline even the histones are replaced with protamines. In plants, the situation is more complex. In collaboration with the Zilberman and Fischer labs, we showed that CG and CHG methylation are in fact reinforced in plant germlines, both in Arabidopsis and rice. This is the opposite of the animal pattern, and is presumably used to ensure faithful inheritance of DNA methylation marks across generations.</p>
        <p>We discovered a particularly interesting phenotype in the CHH context. Most of the CHH methylation found in somatic tissues (such as leaves and roots) is lost in the male germline, but around 1000 sites have either a sharply increased level compared to existing somatic tissues or else completely de novo methylation. The increased sites were mostly associated with transposons, whereas the de novo sites were largely associated with genes. We showed that the meiotic gene MPS1 is regulated by a de novo methylated site on one of its introns – without the methylation, a mis-spliced transcript is produced and fertility is damaged. These observations open up some interesting questions about the regulation of genes and transposons within reproduction, and more broadly within evolution, if there is a mechanistic link between the classes of hypermethylated locus.
        </p>
        <h2>Expression of Transposons in the Vegetative Cell</h2>
        <p>It has been known for several years that there is some activation of transposons in the pollen, specifically in the companion vegetative cells (Slotkin et al., 2009). As a postdoc, Xiaoqi showed the role of the DNA demethylase DEMETER in this activation (Ibarra, Feng et al., 2012). This left two important questions – how extensive was this reactivation, and was DEMETER really enough? Postdoc Shengbo He was able to solve this question by cell sorting and RNA-seq – around 150 TEs are expressed in the vegetative cell. Many of these depend on DEMETER, but the rest depend on the absence of the linker histone H1 from the vegetative cell, allowing transposons in denser heterochromatin to be expressed. </p>
        <h2>Nurse Cell Development</h2>
        <p>A ubiquitous feature of germlines in multicellular organisms is the presence of nurse cells, determinate somatic tissues which provide support to the developing sexual lineage. The nurse cell in the male germline is the tapetum, an object of Xiaoqi’s study since her PhD. Former PhD student Billy Aldridge developed a method to isolate tapetal cells using Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), which has allowed study of their transcriptional profile and DNA methylation. Using single-cell approaches we have been able to follow the developmental progress of the tapetum using RNA-seq, which will be detailed in a forthcoming paper. Related lines of work include the role of endoreduplication in the tapetum, and what part the tapetum plays in the heat stress response. </p>
